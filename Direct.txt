Hi Cliff and Team,

I have conducted a POC by adding a new flag to the HPP form request, and it successfully triggers the manual address input flow within the HPP.

From an API design perspective, if minimizing impact to existing API users is a key requirement, I suggest enhancing the logic within the UK Single API and DCMS as follows:

Change the shipping and billing address fields in the API from required to optional.
If the API user does not submit address fields, DCMS will pass the "enable HPP address input" flag to GP in the background, triggering the manual address input flow.
If the API user provides any value in the address fields, DCMS will pass a "disable HPP address input" flag to GP, ensuring the provided address is used.
This approach maintains backward compatibility while introducing flexibility for users who prefer manual address input. Let me know your thoughts or if any further refinements are needed.

Best regards,
