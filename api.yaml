  - name: Webhooks
    description: |
      ### EVENT-DRIVEN API
      An event-driven REST API is triggered by specific changes or events, instead of traditional explicit request calls to specific endpoints. This allows applications to respond instantly when designated events occur.
      
      ### URL CONFIGURATION
      To receive these callbacks, a URL must be established. This webhook URL can be defined within the ```ORDER```, ```SUBSCRIPTION```, ```PAYID```, or ```QR_CODE``` objects.
      
      Prior to use, the domain of the webhook URL must be registered within the HSBC system. For more information, please reach out to the HSBC team.
      
      The callback is sent using the HTTP POST method. It's essential that the client's exposed endpoint adheres to a security standard of TLS 1.2 or higher. Please note that the server certificate must be provided by a widely recognized commercial certificate authority; self-signed or internally signed certificates won't be accepted.
      
      ### HANDLING EXCEPTIONS
      Any event resulting in a non-2xx response is deemed an event delivery failure, triggering a retry mechanism. A maximum of 4 retries will occur, with each taking place every 2 minutes. This leads to a total of 5 calls, including the first attempt.
      
      ### IDEMPOTENCY
      There may be circumstances in which your endpoint receives the same webhook multiple times. This could occur due to expected behavior like the retry mechanism or unforeseen issues such as network problems.
      
      To manage these duplicate webhooks, we provide a unique webhook ID (referenced as ```x-hsbc-webhook-id``` in the HTTP header) with every webhook. This assists in identifying and processing repeat webhooks appropriately.

      summary: 'Webhook for Refunds'
      description: |
        The refund webhook is designed for an asynchronous refund model. In this model, the refund status of the immediate response following the refund initiation does not represent the final state. Any subsequent status changes, including the final status, will be sent back via callbacks. Note that not all checkout solutions implement the asynchronous refund model. For more detailed information, please refer to the the [Documentation](#apidoccontentid-2596) section.

                                Merchant-assigned Token | When initiating a new Checkout Session, merchants can assign a unique string token.

In subsequent Checkout Sessions, using this same token will activate the auto-fill functionality for the associated card details on the Hosted Checkout Page.

                                System-assigned Token | When merchants opt for the 'save card' feature during the checkout process on the hosted payment page, the payment gateway creates a token. This token, associated with the card details, is securely stored after a successful checkout and is returned in the payment callbacks. In subsequent Checkout Sessions, using this same token will activate the auto-fill functionality for the associated card details on the Hosted Checkout Page.
