I wanted to share a concise overview of our mobile payment flows and the associated confirmation logic.

Mobile Payment Flows
1. Web2App Flow (Browser to Alipay and Back):

From Browser to Alipay:

The user clicks the “Alipay” button on our online shop page in Safari.
Our website triggers a deep link (using a custom URL scheme or universal link) like:
alipay://pay?orderId=12345&amount=50.00&callback=shopapp://paymentResult
This deep link launches the Alipay app.
Returning from Alipay to Browser:

After processing the payment, Alipay uses the provided callback URL to redirect the user back to our shop page in Safari (or web view) along with the payment result.
2. App2App Flow (Shopping App to Alipay and Back):

From Shopping App to Alipay:

The user taps “Pay with Alipay” in the shopping app.
The shopping app constructs and triggers a deep link (or Android intent) like:
alipay://pay?orderId=12345&amount=50.00&callback=shoppingapp://paymentResult
This launches the Alipay app with the order details.
Returning from Alipay to Shopping App:

Once the payment is complete, Alipay calls the callback URL.
The deep link (or intent) takes the user back to the shopping app, passing along the payment result.
Payment Confirmation Logic
While the callback URL provides an immediate, front-end confirmation by redirecting the user back to the merchant’s app or page, this confirmation is considered preliminary. For a robust and secure confirmation of payment status, our backend should also wait for an asynchronous notification (such as a webhook) from the payment service provider (e.g., Alipay).

Key Points:

Frontend (Callback URL):

Primarily used to return the user to the merchant’s app or web page.
Should not be solely trusted for the actual payment status, since it might fail if the user cancels the process or accidentally closes the app.
Backend (Payment Notification):

Acts as the single source of trust for the payment status.
Ensures reliability by confirming the transaction asynchronously, independent of the user interface.
Note:
Combining the front-end confirmation (callback URL) with the backend confirmation (payment notification) may introduce additional complexity for the merchant. Therefore, if we follow the existing logic of the HPP flow, the front-end confirmation should be used only to navigate the user back to the merchant's app or page, with the backend payment notification being the definitive source for payment status.

Let me know if you have any questions or need further details.
