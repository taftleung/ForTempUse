Hi YP,

Testing Apple Pay in HPP may introduce some complexities. Here are the key points to consider:

Lack of Official Documentation – There is no official GP guide available for Apple Pay setup. We may need to consult GP to confirm if domain verification or any other configurations (similar to what we did for Geidea) are required.

Testing Constraints – Apple Pay cannot be tested on a local PC. We must access the HPP from a publicly accessible internet network using an iOS device for proper testing.

Could you please check with our technical team to confirm if we already have the necessary setup in place?

Once everything is set up, we only need to add a single field to the HPP submit form to enable Apple Pay.

Best regards,
