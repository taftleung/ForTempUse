Hey Ryan,

I wanted to break down my pay rate for you so you have a clear picture of how my annual earnings are calculated (all figures are before tax).

Daily Rate:
I earn £384 per day. This is a “no work, no pay” arrangement, so I only get paid for the days I actually work.

Working Days Calculation:

There are 261 potential working days in a year (this excludes Saturdays and Sundays).
From these, I take 33 days off as annual leave (this includes all public holidays).
So, the number of actual working days per year is:
261 days − 33 days = 228 days
Annual Earnings Calculation:

Multiply the number of working days by the daily rate:
228 days × £384/day = £87,552 per year
That’s the basic outline of how my annual pay is determined while working in the UK with Teksystem as my agent.
